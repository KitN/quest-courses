# quest-courses
A simple script to scrape some data using the [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) python web scraping library.

The page that is scraped, `Question Plans.html` is hosted on Quest University Canada's private web portal, and so this script is of little value to anyone outside of the university. This repository is mostly for demonstration and I didn't want to use up one of my private github repositories for such a small project.
